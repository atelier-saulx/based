# Releases

This document provides a high-level overview of our database release plan.
It highlights the major planned evolutions and key milestones, without getting into extensive technical details.
Version numers could change due to nightly releases.

## v0.1.0 (Sep 2025)

**Include**

- 20% faster performance from internal optimizations
- New API feature: Meta information for adding contextual information like crc32, size and checksum.
- New API feature: "End option" allowing getting the start of a property, by default counts characters for strings and text including multibyte characters.
- Read is now fully supported in the `@based/client`, removing the need to call `.toObject()` when returning data from based functions
- Reading and deserializing database results is now 30% faster.

**Query**

- Id on a based query response now returns the id of a node if the target is single node
- Added queryId that is the

**Backups**

- Backup improvement. IoWorker threads for non blocking saving and loading (huge improvement)
- Start of partial loading of backups (works for types without references)
- Improved backup checksums

**Modify**

- Refactor of all client code, much cleaner and easier to understand codebase
- Offset system in place allows offloading validation & modify buffer preparation to db-client
- Growing preallocated modify buffer (saves memory if a low amount is used)
- Better support for async reference
- Better migration using native lastIds where applicable
- Better validation for most types - works better with customValidators as well
- New api feature: Standardizes modify result: Promise

**Aggregations**

- Date/time & intervals in Aggregations: Aggregate functions now supports date, time, and interval data types.
- Grouping by time windows, named intervals (day, week, ISO week, ISO year, etc) with timezone support
- Group by reference node IDs
- `BaseType` options for `'vector'` (8/16/32-bit integers and 32/64-bit floating-points)
- New harmonic_mean aggregation function
- Improved stddev and variance option to compute on sample or population mode

**Interoperability**

- New package: Export to CSV
- We're introducing a new dedicated package for generating compliant CSV files from dumped datasets

**Schema**

- Infer typescript utility to infer types from the schema
- Introduced Schema Migration format:
  - Allows you to define custom transformations between schema versions making it easy to migrate
- New API feature: Schema hooks
  - Allows overwriting of each method for specific nodes
    e.g. `url docs`

**General Fixes & Improvements**

- Fixed stability issues with `.expire()`
- Fixed condition length of strict equality fixed string filters
- Fixed out of bounds read for an edge case with search
- Fixed incorrect timestamp validation, not allowing dates before 1970
- Fixed incorrect reading of references data for certain edge cases
- Fixed incorrect length encoding of filters on cardinality (from 2 to 4 bytes)
- Fixed defaults for enums are now handled correctly
- Fixed arbitrary unloading of WorkerCtx by napi external
  - solves filtering on compressed data (avoids **segfault**)
  - solves db process getting stuck when the db variable goes out of scope in js
- Fixed all handling of modify cursor mismatches on error

**Documentation & Examples**

- Start of documentation can be found [here](db/)
- Northwind sample dataset - comparing SQL to BasedDb

**Based Platform**

- Alpha version of new environment hub & cli
  - Builds and watches large projects
  - Reconnects
  - Uses based-dbn on new env-hub this will go further in the future
- Launcher for Linux testing on MacOS
- Start of @based/protocol will centralize all protocols in 1 place

### Breaking changes

- _Changed the $count result in aggegrations with [.....]_
- Filter operation `has` has been renamed to `Ã¬ncludes`. As shown in the [docs](db/filtering?id=operators)
- Removed `transform` opton from schema properties in favor of Schema Hooks
- Removed `upsert` option from references modify api in favor of newly created `db.upsert` command. See the [docs](db/upsert)\*
- BasedQueryResponse now uses id for node ids vs the queryId
- Don't allow setting a string to text props without a locale
