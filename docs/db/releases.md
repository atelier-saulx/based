# Release Plan

This document provides a high-level overview of our database release plan.
It highlights the major planned evolutions and key milestones, without getting into extensive technical details.
Note that version numbers may change due to nightly releases.

## v0.1.1 (Sep 2025)

**Include**

- 20% faster performance from internal optimizations
- New API feature: Metadata for adding contextual information like crc32, size, and checksum.
- New API feature: "End option" allows to get the end of a property, by default counts characters for strings and text including multibyte characters.
- Reading is now fully supported in the `@based/client`, removing the need to call `.toObject()` when returning data from based functions
- Reading and deserializing database results is now 30% faster.

**Query**

- Id prop on a based query response now returns the ID of a node if the target is a single node
- Added queryId that is the

**Backups**

- Backup improvement. I/O worker threads for non-blocking saving and loading (a huge improvement)
- Start of [partial](https://atelier-saulx.github.io/based/#/db/internals?id=partial-data) loading of backups (works for types without references)
- Improved backup checksums

**Modify**

- Refactored all client code for a much cleaner and easier-to-understand codebase
- An offset system is now in place, allowing the offloading of validation and modify buffer preparation to the DB client
- A growing preallocated modify buffer (saves memory when a low amount is used)
- Better support for async reference
- Better migration using native lastIds where applicable
- Improved validation for most types, which also works better with _customValidators_
- New API feature: The modify result is now standardized as a _Promise_

**Aggregations**

- [Date/time & intervals in Aggregations](https://atelier-saulx.github.io/based/#/db/aggregate?id=temporal-grouping-time-based-aggregations): Aggregate functions now supports date, time, and interval data types.
- Grouping by time windows, named intervals (day, week, ISO week, ISO year, etc) with [timezone support](https://atelier-saulx.github.io/based/#/db/aggregate?id=working-with-timezones)
- [Group by reference node IDs](https://atelier-saulx.github.io/based/#/db/aggregate?id=grouping-by-reference-node-ids)
- `BaseType` options for `'vector'` (8/16/32-bit integers and 32/64-bit floating-points)
- New [harmonic_mean](https://atelier-saulx.github.io/based/#/db/aggregate?id=hmeanproperty-string-string) aggregation function
- Improved [stddev and variance option to compute on [sample or population mode](https://atelier-saulx.github.io/based/#/db/aggregate?id=stddevproperty-string-string-options-mode-39sample39-39population39-)

**Interoperability**

- New package: [Export to CSV](https://atelier-saulx.github.io/based/#/db/export)
  - We're introducing a new dedicated package for generating compliant CSV files from dumped datasets

**Schema**

- A TypeScript utility to infer types from the schema
- Introduced Schema Migration format:
  - Allows you to define custom transformations between schema versions making it easy to migrate
- New API feature: Schema hooks
  - Allows overwriting each method for specific nodes
    e.g. `url docs`

**General Fixes & Improvements**

- Fixed stability issues with `.expire()`
- Fixed condition length of var string filters
- Fixed out of bounds read for an edge case with search
- Fixed incorrect timestamp validation, not allowing dates before 1970
- Fixed incorrect reading of references data for certain edge cases
- Fixed incorrect length encoding of filters on cardinality (from 2 to 4 bytes)
- Fixed defaults for enums are now handled correctly
- Fixed arbitrary unloading of WorkerCtx by napi external
  - solves filtering on compressed data (avoids **segfault**)
  - solves db process getting stuck when the db variable goes out of scope in js
- Fixed all handling of modify cursor mismatches during errors

**Documentation & Examples**

- Initial documentation can be found [here](https://atelier-saulx.github.io/based/#/)
- [Northwind sample dataset](https://atelier-saulx.github.io/based/#/db/sql?id=northwind-sample-database) - comparing SQL to BasedDb

**Based Platform**

- Alpha version of new environment hub & cli
  - Builds and watches large projects
  - Reconnects
  - Uses based-db on new env-hub this will be expanded further in the future
- Launcher for Linux testing on MacOS
- Initial @based/protocol to centralize all protocols in 1 place
- @saulx/utils is replaced by `@based/utils`; please use this in the future
- @saulx/hash is replaced by `@based/hash`; please use this in the future

### Breaking changes

- \*Changed the `$count` result in aggregations to `count`
- Filter operation `has` has been renamed to `Ã¬ncludes`. As shown in the [documentation](https://atelier-saulx.github.io/based/#/db/filtering?id=operators)
- Removed the `transform` option from _schema_ properties in favor of _schema hooks_
- Removed the `upsert` option from _references_ modify api in favor of newly created `db.upsert` command.
- The _BasedQueryResponse_ now uses _id_ for node IDs, as opposed to the _queryId_
- Setting a string to _text_ properties without a _locale_ is no longer allowed
