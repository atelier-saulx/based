<h2>3 Why we use your data and on what legal grounds</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Operate the voting system and determine results</strong> — <em>Contract performance</em> (Art 6 (1)(b))</li>
<li><strong>Process payments and possible refunds</strong> — <em>Contract performance</em> (Art 6 (1)(b))</li>
<li><strong>Detect and prevent fraud or abuse</strong> — <em>Legitimate interest</em> (Art 6 (1)(f))</li>
<li><strong>Meet bookkeeping, tax and AML obligations</strong> — <em>Legal obligation</em> (Art 6 (1)(c))</li>
<li><strong>Publish anonymised statistics on voting behaviour</strong> — <em>Legitimate interest</em> (Art 6 (1)(f))</li>
</ul>

<h2>4 Automated fraud-scoring by Stripe</h2>

<p>Stripe applies state-of-the-art risk profiling to every payment transaction using a wide range of signals. If your transaction’s risk score exceeds a threshold, our platform automatically rejects the payment transaction and your vote is not counted. Because the contest runs live, we cannot provide real-time human review of such decisions.</p>

<h2>5 International transfers</h2>

<ul>
<li>Your vote data are stored on servers located in the <strong>European Union</strong>.</li>
<li>Stripe may transfer payment-related data to the <strong>United States</strong> or other countries. These transfers rely on the <strong>EU Standard Contractual Clauses (2021/914, Modules 1 &amp; 2)</strong>, including UK and Swiss addenda where required.</li>
<li>Copies of the contractual safeguards can be obtained via the contact details above.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6 How long we keep your data</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Vote records</strong> (vote selections, geolocation, payment identifiers) — <strong>7 years</strong> as key company records.</li>
<li><strong>Payment records</strong> (transaction data) — <strong>10 years</strong> under German tax law (§ 147 AO).</li>
<li><strong>Server access logs</strong> (IP, user-agent) — deleted or anonymised after <strong>14 days</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregated, fully anonymised statistics</strong> — kept indefinitely.</li>
</ul>

<p>Data are deleted or irreversibly anonymised once the retention period ends, unless a legal dispute requires longer storage.</p>

<h2>7 Cookies &amp; similar technology</h2>

<p>We set <strong>only strictly necessary cookies</strong> provided by Stripe to secure payment processing (for example, to generate a device fingerprint that prevents card fraud).<br/>
These cookies:</p>

<ol>
<li>are essential for casting a paid vote and therefore <strong>do not require consent</strong> under EU ePrivacy rules;</li>
<li>are disclosed to you <strong>before you enter</strong> the site via a clear notice;</li>
<li>cannot be disabled without preventing payment.</li>
</ol>

<h2>8 Children</h2>

<p>The Voting Platform is <strong>not directed at individuals under 18 years of age</strong>. If you are under 18, please obtain parental consent before voting.</p>

<h2>9 Security measures</h2>

<p>We protect your data with TLS 1.3 in transit, AES-256 encryption at rest, strict role-based access, 24 ⁄ 7 infrastructure monitoring and regular penetration testing.</p>

<h2>10 Your data-protection rights</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Access</strong> – receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</li>
<li><strong>Rectification</strong> – correct inaccuracies in data we control (note: payment-card metadata and Stripe-generated risk scores cannot be edited by us).</li>
<li><strong>Erasure</strong> – request deletion where legally possible. Voting and payment data cannot be erased without breaching our statutory obligations.</li>
<li><strong>Restriction</strong> – ask us to pause processing where you contest accuracy or legality.</li>
<li><strong>Portability</strong> – obtain the data you provided in a machine-readable format.</li>
<li><strong>Object</strong> – if you disagree with processing based on legitimate interest, you may refrain from using the service; once you vote, processing is essential to deliver that service.</li>
</ul>

<p>To exercise any right, email either controller (see § 1). Proof of identity may be required. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with any EU supervisory authority; our lead authority is the North Rhine-Westphalia Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (LDI NRW).</p>
