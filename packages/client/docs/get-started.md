# Getting started

The first step in getting started with using Based is creating a new project. To do so, after logging in, click the `+ New Project` button and type in a new project name.  
Each project can have multiple environments (e.g. development and production).

In order to start adding data to the project, a **schema** is needed. The schema defines your data types, for examples the users of a chat app. To add a new type, click the `+ Create a new type` button.  
Each type can have any number of fields that describe it, for example a user's email. These can be added in the schema editor using the `+ Add Type` button.

Next, it's time to add some content! This can be done through the Dashboard using the built-in content editor.

Once the environment is up and running, it is time to jump into the code side of things. [Click here to read more about the Based SDK](../README.md)
